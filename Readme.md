# LaForge [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/laforge.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/laforge)

By [Combinaut](http://www.combinaut.com).

**LaForge** is a gem that makes it easy to build records using data from several data sources. It aims to facilitate
management of which data sources a record is assembled from, and to perform the actual data assembly in order to output
a record.

Key features:

- Allows published content to be edited without those changes immediately being seen by visitors
- Can selectively update content without needing to sync the entire database with production

## Setup
1. Add **Laforge** to your Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  gem 'laforge', github: 'combinaut/laforge'
  ```

2. Add laforge to your model.

  ```ruby
    # In your model
    class MyModel < ApplicationModel
      laforged
    end
  ```

## Usage

1. Create some sources and prioritize them, giving higher priority to sources whose attributes should override those
   same attributes from lower priority sources.

  ```ruby
    source1 = LaForge::DataSource.create(name: 'Encyclopedia Britannica', priority: 2)
    source2 = LaForge::DataSource.create(name: 'Wikipedia', priority: 1)
  ```

2. Build a new model, or update an existing one with data from any of your sources.

  ```ruby
    foo = MyModel.new
    foo.record_data_entries({ height: 20, width: 5 }, source1)
    foo.record_data_entries({ height: 19, name: 'El Capitan' }, source2)
    foo.forge! # => Saves the model with the attributes { height: 20, width: 5, name: 'El Capitan' }
  ```

### Overriding Priority

The priority of a data entry can be customized to override the priority inherited from the data source.

  ```ruby
    foo = MyModel.new
    foo.record_data_entries({ height: 20, width: 5 }, source1)
    foo.record_data_entries({ height: 19 }, source2, priority: 3) # Override the priority inherited from the data source
    foo.forge! # => Saves the model with the attributes { height: 19, width: 5 }
  ```

### Querying
  ```ruby
    MyModel.with_source(source1) # => All records from source1
    MyModel.without_source(source1) # => All records not from source1

    MyModel.with_attribute(:height) # => All records with a recorded height attribute from any source
    MyModel.without_attribute(:height) # => All records without a recorded height attribute from any source

    MyModel.with_attribute_with_source(:height, source1) # => All records with a recorded height attribute from source1
    MyModel.with_attribute_with_source([:height, :width], source1) # => All records with a recorded height or width attribute from source1

    MyModel.with_attribute_without_source(:height, source1) # => All records with a recorded height not from source1
    MyModel.with_attribute_without_source([:height, :width], source1) # => All records with a recorded height or width attribute not from source1
    MyModel.with_attribute_with_source(:height, source1).with_attribute_with_source(:width, source1) # => All records with both a recorded height and width attribute from source1

    MyModel.without_attribute_with_source(:height, source1) # => All records without a recorded height attribute from source1
    MyModel.without_attribute_with_source([:height, :width], source1) # => All records missing a recorded height or missing a recorded width from source1
    MyModel.without_attribute_with_source(:height, source1).without_attribute_with_source(:width, source1) # => All records without both a recorded height and width attribute from source1
  ```
